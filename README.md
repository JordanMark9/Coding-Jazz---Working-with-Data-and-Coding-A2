## General Info 

This project is called Coding Jazz, and it uses TunePad and Python coding language to create a piece of jazz music.
This was a personal challenge I set for myself, as I have pre-existing musical knowledge but very minimal coding knowledge.
Therefore, this prototype has aided in extending my knowledge of code and taught me more about coding with Python. This means that it solved a personal creative challenge, merging my love for music with learning about how to code with Python.

Despite limitations to using TunePad as a coding program, e.g. that it doesn't afford all Python features like f strings, I was able to find alternatives and teach myself new ways to achieve the intended outcomes. This includes using nested loops and also 2 2-dimensional lists, or lists of lists to repeat rhythms at different melodies. Although it took a while to figure out how to use these features, the end result meant my code was much more condensed, and I could learn more than I would have by just using a normal loop and the "playNote" function. 

Further, a large part of the challenge of using Tunepad and coding to create jazz is that Jazz as a genre is usually quite flowing, not as strict as coding music usually allows. However, research into python libraries showed me to use "with swing():" functions to add bounce to rhythms, removing the more mechanical precision that TunePad creates and making it sound more human. 


## Technologies Used

The technologies used for this project were TunePad and Python.
They were used to create the code alongside a wealth of online resources and coding libraries, which will be listed in the sources.
