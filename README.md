## General Info 

This project is called Coding with Jazz, and it uses TunePad and Python coding language to create a piece of jazz music.
This was a personal challenge I set for myself, as I have pre-existing musical knowledge but very minimal coding knowledge.
Therefore, this prototype has aided in extending my knowledge of code and taught me more about coding with Python. This means that it solved a personal creative challenge, merging my love for music with learning about how to code with Python.

The prototype contains 4 different instruments: flat synth, electric bass, piano and drums to create the song. 

Despite limitations to using TunePad as a coding program, e.g. that it doesn't afford all Python features like f strings, I was able to find alternatives and teach myself new ways to achieve the intended outcomes. This includes using nested loops and also 2-dimensional lists, or lists of lists to repeat rhythms at different melodies. Although it took a while to figure out how to use these features, the end result meant my code was much more condensed, and I could learn more than I would have by just using a normal loop and the "playNote" function. 

Further, a large part of the challenge of using Tunepad and coding to create jazz, is that Jazz as a genre is usually quite flowing, and not as strict as coding music usually allows. However, research into TunePad libraries showed me to use "with swing():" functions to add bounce to rhythms, removing the more mechanical precision that TunePad creates and making it sound more human. 




## Technologies Used

The technologies used for this project were TunePad and Python.
They were used to create the code alongside a wealth of online resources and coding libraries, which will be listed in the sources. Where I have used external resources to help me write my code has been written clearly in the code comments, alongside a reference list specific to the resources used to help create my Code on my TunePad website. 



## Features

Some of the features of my code prototype include:
* 4 Different instruments that each have unique lines of code
* Nested loops to repeat certain phrases within a larger loop, e.g.:

* 2 Dimensional Lists created to play changing measure melodies against a single rhythm measure, and repeat certain measures as seen in the code for the bass.


## Setup

Since this prototype was created using TunePad, the setup is simple. Follow the File titled "Coding with Jazz - Tunepad" and click the link to open the project. Alternatively, follow this link: https://tunepad.com/project/86208

Then, click the play button in the top right hand corner to play the song, and scroll down through to view the code for each individual instrument and the code comments that state if there was a source used/information/explanation regarding the code and its purpose. 

If you want to view the code as a JSON file, please see the file titled tunepad_project_86208 (3) JSON. 


## Status

The prototype is no longer being worked on. When it comes to creating music, there will always be more you can add to it, but for now, this is the extent to which the Jazz piece I have created will be worked on. I feel as if the level at which it is has taught me an extensive amount regarding Python coding.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
* If there was more time to complete the project, there could be other instruments added to add more depth to the piece of music, but due to the time-constrained nature of this assessment, only 4 instruments were used to ensure that enough time could be spent on refining and learning new Python coding practices.
* Another improvement could be exploring even more TunePad projects to see what other code has been used. Since Python is somewhat limited in TunePad, and there are different functions, it was often difficult to figure out how to do something I was trying to achieve, e.g. creating the 2 Dimensional list.
